\section{Background and previous work}
The ability to model and automatically detect discourse structure is crucial for any NLP applications. It's even more important in spoken dialog system because the system needs to take action based on the structure of dialog history.
Dialog act is a specialized speech act which normally includes acts such as promising, ordering, greeting, warning, inviting and congratulatiing. Different dialog systems may also introduce domain specific acts. 

Research in dialog acts increases since 1999, after spoken dialog  systems became commercial reality. There are generally two ways to identify speech act, namely script-based method and learning-based method. In our task it's actually a classifying problem rather than an identifying problem. So we here will generally give a short review of learning based methods in this area.

\subsection{Dialog Act prediction as sequential labeling problem}
Strictly speaking Dialog Act prediction is quite different to typical sequential labeling problem such as POS tagging or speech recognition. The reason is that in traditional sequential labeling problem, the observed states which are required to be tagged are all available or at least a bunch of them are available as a minimal unit. However, in dialog act prediction problem, the observed states are dynamic and growing. And during run time, the dialog act predictor cares more about current state. Though the previous states may contain errors, the system would not have any interests to retag them and correct the mistakes in the history. This kinds of reflects the two different natures of theses two tasks.

However, we can still use sequential labeling methods to treat this problem. This is based on these observation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item First of all, we can consider the each dialog as a processing unit. During running time, we can consider the incomplete dialog as a unit to be tagged. Based on our observation, this way works in practice. We consider it may be relative to CRF's global optimization way to decode. 
    \item Secondly, in running time, there are actually two different types of tasks:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item recognize the speech act of the user. This is identical to sequential tagging problem since there is a observable variable for current hidden state.
            \item generate the right speech act of the system. This is different from sequential tagging problem because for the current hidden state, there is no observable data about it. To make sequential labeling work with it, we can shift the data alignment, e.g, we can consider the current hidden state is emitted from the previous observable data as demonstrated in Table \ref{table:system_align} 
        \end{itemize}
